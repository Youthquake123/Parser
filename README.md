## The implementation of lexical and syntax analyser

1. Design and implement a Lexical analyser using regular grammar. Create rules which can be used in one language subset.
The symbol which is needed in your source program should be designed in your LA. Some reserve words include: eg. int, float, double, if, else, for, do, while, etc…… should be explained.

2. Design and implement a parser to understand recursive decent parsing process.
